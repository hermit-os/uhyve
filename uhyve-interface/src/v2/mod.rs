//! # Uhyve Hypervisor Interface V2
//!
//! The Uhyve hypercall interface works as follows:
//!
//! - The guest writes (or reads) to the respective [`HypercallAddress`](v2::HypercallAddress). The 64-bit value written to that location is the guest's physical memory address of the hypercall's parameter.
//! - The hypervisor handles the hypercall. Depending on the Hypercall, the hypervisor might change the parameters struct in the guest's memory.
