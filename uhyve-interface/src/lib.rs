//! # Uhyve Hypervisor Interface
//!
//! The uhyve hypercall interface works as follows:
//!
//! - On `x86_64` you use an out port instruction. The address of the `out`-port corresponds to the
//! hypercall you want to use. You can obtain it from the [`IoPorts`] enum. The data send to
//! that port is the physical memory address (of the VM) of the parameters of that hypercall.
//! - On `aarch64` you write to the respective [`HypercallAddress`]. The 64-bit value written to that location is the guest's physical memory address of the hypercall's parameter.

// TODO: Throw this out, once https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/2783 or https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/86772 is resolved
